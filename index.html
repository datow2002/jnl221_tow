		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/" target="_blank">Hip hop vocabulary</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Drones dropped in Pakistan</a>, Pitch Interactive</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I analyzed the "Hip hop vocabulary" article, which draws its lyrical data from Genius, a website that shows lyrics to songs. The dataviz used in the article is a scatter plot displaying each rappers' # of unique words within their first 35000 lyrics, as well as a bar graph displaying the same thing, but sorting the rappers into ranges based on their respective word counts. There is also a combination area/bar graph displaying rap vs country and pop when it comes to unique words. The key message this article is trying to show is which rappers have the most unique vocabularies, as well as that rappers have extensive vocabularies in general, and use many different words to convey their messages within their songs. I think this article could be a little more focused on the second point, as it spends a lot of time comparing different rappers to each other to find which ones are the most lyrically unique, rather than comparing to other genres. The first 2 graphs display the same data in different ways, discussing which rappers are more lyrically unique than their peers, while the third graph compares rap as a whole versus other genres. I think this article wasn't very visceral, as the graphs themselves did not cause me to react emotionally. Rather, I examined them for what they displayed, and moved on. So while they have some interesting visual elements, such as the 2nd graph using names to complete its bars rather than actual bars, the author could have done a better job of making their graphs more memorable and visceral. </p>

		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>
